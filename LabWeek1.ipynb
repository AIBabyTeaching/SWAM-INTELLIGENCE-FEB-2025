    "#### 1. Initialize Swarm\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Define the problem to be optimized.\n",
    "- Choose swarm intelligence algorithm (e.g., PSO, ACO).\n",
    "- Set parameters such as population size, initial velocity (if applicable), pheromone levels (for ACO), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "- Number of agents (swarm size).\n",
    "- Search space boundaries.\n",
    "- Randomized or predefined initial positions and states of agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**\n",
    "- Initialized swarm (agents with initial positions, velocities, or states).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Evaluate Fitness\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Define a fitness function that evaluates how good a solution is.\n",
    "- Ensure the function maps the search space to a numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "- Current positions of all agents in the swarm.\n",
    "- Fitness function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**\n",
    "- Fitness values for each agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Communication\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Establish a method for agents to share information (e.g., best solutions found).\n",
    "- Implement communication strategies (e.g., local or global best sharing in PSO, pheromone updating in ACO).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "- Fitness values of all agents.\n",
    "- Neighboring agents' information (for local updates).\n",
    "- Global best solution (if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**\n",
    "- Updated shared knowledge (e.g., global best solution in PSO, updated pheromone trails in ACO).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Update Swarm\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Apply update rules based on the specific algorithm.\n",
    "- Modify agents' positions, velocities, or states based on learned information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "- Current swarm state (positions, velocities, pheromones, etc.).\n",
    "- Communication results (e.g., best-known solutions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**\n",
    "- New positions or states for agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Meet Termination Conditions\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Define stopping criteria (e.g., max iterations, convergence threshold, acceptable solution quality).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "- Current best fitness value.\n",
    "- Iteration count.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**\n",
    "- Decision: Continue the loop (go back to **Evaluate Fitness**) or terminate the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. End\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- The algorithm must have reached a solution or exhausted search conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "- Best solution found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**\n",
    "- Final optimized solution.\n"
